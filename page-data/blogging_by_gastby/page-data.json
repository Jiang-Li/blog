But recently I used Python more and would like to switch a more general tool. The static site built by Gastby, which is powered by React, is pretty fast. So I decided to give a try. Here is the workflow of blogging:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the project folder, enter:\n<code class=\"language-text\">gatsby develop</code></li>\n<li>Add new markdown file in the content/blog. I will prefer to build folder for each post, and compose a index.md inside the folder.</li>\n<li>To deploy, run <code class=\"language-text\">npm run deploy</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>The blog is build based on Gatsby’s blog starter. </p>\n<p>To create the template\n<code class=\"language-text\">gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog</code>.</p>\n<p>I added code highlighting and modified the bio. I also want Table of Contents, and will add it later.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blogging by Gastby","date":"July 20, 2019","description":"Try to use Gastby for blogging."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blogging_by_gastby/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/commonly-used_scripts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Often-used Scripts"}},"next":null}}}
